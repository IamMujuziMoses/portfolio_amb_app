This is the Flutter Siro Ambulance app

## Getting started with Siro Ambulance

Siro is an emergency based app with Uber like features where patients can request for ambulance services
or medical emergency responses. In addition to instant emergency alerts (Ambulance request), the app will provide
consultation services, and users will be able to book appointments, sets reminders and get updates and medical
emergency alerts from the ministry of Health (MoH).

Patients will therefore be able to receive medical attention in the shortest time possible. This app will target
all user base especially those who are prone to lethal medical conditions (Heart conditions, hypertension, diabetes,
etc.) that need emergencies at their reach at all times.
